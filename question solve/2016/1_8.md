# Cryptography Exam Answers

## Section–A

### 1.

**(a)** Playfair Cipher Definition and Example

* A **Playfair cipher** is a digraph substitution cipher that encrypts pairs of letters using a 5×5 matrix generated from a keyword.

**Steps:**

1. Write the keyword “DHAKA” (remove duplicates) → `DHAK`.
2. Fill remaining alphabet (I/J combined) →

```
D H A K B
C E F G I
L M N O P
Q R S T U
V W X Y Z
```

**Encrypt “BANGLADESH”:**
Divide into digraphs: BA | NG | LA | DE | SH

* BA → BD
* NG → OM
* LA → NM
* DE → EC
* SH → TR
  **Ciphertext:** `BDOMNMECTR`

**(b)** Feistel Cipher & Importance

* A **Feistel cipher** divides plaintext into left and right halves. Each round applies a function `F` to one half and XORs it with the other.
* Used in DES and modern symmetric designs.
  **Importance:** Enables decryption using same structure with reversed subkeys.

**(c)** MIME

* **Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (MIME)** standardizes format for sending binary files, images, or attachments via email using Base64 encoding.

### 2.

**(a)** Trapdoor One-Way Function vs One-Way Hash Function

* **One-way function:** Easy to compute, hard to invert (e.g., `f(x) = x² mod n`).
* **Trapdoor one-way function:** Becomes easy to invert with secret info (trapdoor). Used in RSA.
* **One-way hash function:** Maps variable-length input to fixed-length digest; ensures integrity (e.g., SHA-256).

**(b)** Signing a Document

1. Compute hash `H(M)`.
2. Encrypt hash with private key `SK_A` → Signature.
3. Receiver decrypts with sender’s public key to verify authenticity.

**(c)** Timestamps and Their Importance

* Attach time info to messages for non-repudiation and replay protection.
* Example: Digital certificates use timestamps to validate token freshness.

### 3.

**(a)** Birthday Attack

* Based on probability of hash collisions; for n-bit hash, collision expected after 2^(n/2) trials.
* Used against digital signatures to find two messages with same hash.

**(b)** Effect of Reduced Key Space

* Smaller keyspace increases brute-force risk.
* Example: 56-bit DES broken in hours; modern AES uses 128+ bits.

**(c)** Importance of Key Update / Destruction

* Key rotation limits compromise impact.
* Destroy old keys by overwriting, revoking certificates, and removing backups securely.

### 4.

**(a)** Prime Numbers & Lehmann’s Test

* Prime = integer divisible only by 1 and itself.
* **Lehmann’s Test:** Randomly pick `a` < `n`; compute `a^{(n−1)/2} mod n`.
  If result ≠ ±1 mod n, then n is composite; else probably prime.

**(b)** DES Initial and Final Permutations

* **Initial Permutation (IP):** Rearranges plaintext bits.
* **Final Permutation (FP):** Inverse of IP applied after 16 rounds.

**(c)** Triple DES (3DES)

* Repeats DES three times: Encrypt–Decrypt–Encrypt.
  `C = E_{K3}(D_{K2}(E_{K1}(P)))`.
* Effective key size ≈ 112 bits.

### 5.

**(a)** Generating Longer Hash Values

* Concatenate multiple hashes: `H = H1 || H2` using different salts or counters.
* Use HMAC/HKDF for expansion.

**(b)** Secure Hash Algorithm (SHA)

* Family of cryptographic hash functions (SHA-1, SHA-2, SHA-3).
* Output sizes: 160–512 bits.
* Used in SSL, blockchain, digital signatures.

**(c)** RSA Algorithm Example
Given p=5, q=7, e=11
→ n=35, φ(n)=24, find d such that 11d ≡1(mod24) ⇒ d=11.
Encrypt m=12 → c=12¹¹ mod35=17.
Decrypt: 17¹¹ mod35=12 ✅.

### 6.

**(a)** Key Distribution & Diffie–Hellman

* Diffie–Hellman enables shared key computation without prior exchange.
  Given q=353, α=3, XA=97, XB=233 → Shared K=160.

**(b)** Types of Intruders

1. **Masquerader:** External attacker posing as legitimate user.
2. **Misfeasor:** Insider misusing privileges.
3. **Clandestine User:** Hides activities; disables audit logs.

**(c)** Protecting Password Files

* Store salted hashes using PBKDF2/bcrypt/Argon2.
* Apply access control & periodic password rotation.

---

### 7.

**(a)** Logic Bomb
Malicious code triggered by event/time; used in sabotage. Example: deletes files on specific date.

**(b)** R64 Conversion

* Converts binary → ASCII (Base64).
* 3 bytes → 4 text chars.
* Ensures safe email transmission (used in MIME & PGP).

**(c)** Password Management

* Use long, unique passwords & password managers.
* Enforce MFA and regular expiration.

---

### 8.

**(a)** IPsec Encryption & Authentication using ESP

* **ESP (Encapsulating Security Payload):** Provides encryption, authentication, and replay protection.
* **Modes:**

  * **Transport Mode:** Encrypts payload only.
  * **Tunnel Mode:** Encrypts full packet (for VPNs).

**(b)** Characteristics of Secure Hash Function

1. Preimage resistant (hard to find M from H(M)).
2. Second preimage resistant.
3. Collision resistant.
4. Deterministic output, fast to compute.
