## Question 1 Answers (Set 2)

### (a) What is a Cryptanalytic Attack? Differentiate between Known-Plaintext Attack and Chosen-Ciphertext Attack.

**Cryptanalytic Attack:**
A cryptanalytic attack is a method of breaking an encryption algorithm by studying the ciphertext and exploiting weaknesses in the cryptographic system to recover the plaintext or key without having prior access to them.

**Types:**

* **Known-Plaintext Attack (KPA):** The attacker has access to one or more plaintext–ciphertext pairs. The goal is to deduce the encryption key or find a pattern for future decryption.
* **Chosen-Ciphertext Attack (CCA):** The attacker can choose arbitrary ciphertexts and obtain their corresponding plaintexts, allowing deeper analysis to reveal the encryption key.

|     **Feature**    | **Known-Plaintext Attack**        | **Chosen-Ciphertext Attack**                           |
| :----------------: | :-------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------- |
| **Attacker knows** | Some plaintext and its ciphertext | Ciphertext of their choice and corresponding plaintext |
|     **Control**    | Passive (limited control)         | Active (attacker chooses ciphertexts)                  |
|      **Goal**      | Deduce encryption key             | Deduce decryption process or key                       |
|     **Example**    | WWII Enigma attacks               | Modern attacks on RSA (Bleichenbacher attack)          |

### (b) Caesar Cipher + Transposition Cipher (Width = 5)

**Plaintext:** `I LOVE MY COUNTRY`

#### Step 1: Caesar Cipher (shift = 3)

Shift each letter 3 positions forward (A→D, B→E, etc.)

| Plaintext | Ciphertext |
| :-------: | :--------: |
|     I     |      L     |
|     L     |      O     |
|     O     |      R     |
|     V     |      Y     |
|     E     |      H     |
|     M     |      P     |
|     Y     |      B     |
|     C     |      F     |
|     O     |      R     |
|     U     |      X     |
|     N     |      Q     |
|     T     |      W     |
|     R     |      U     |
|     Y     |      B     |

**After Caesar Cipher:**
`LORYH PB FRXQWUB`

#### Step 2: Transposition Cipher (Width = 5)

Write in rows of 5:

```
L O R Y H
P B   F R
X Q W U B
```

**Read column-wise:**

```
L P X O B Q R F W Y R U H B
```

**Final Ciphertext:** `LPXOBQRFWYRUHB`

### (c) One-Time Pad and Its Unbreakability

**One-Time Pad (OTP):**
A one-time pad is an encryption technique where the plaintext is combined with a random key of the same length using XOR (in binary form). Each key is used only once.

**Encryption Rule:**
`Ciphertext = Plaintext ⊕ Key`

**Example:**
Plaintext = `HELLO` (binary)
Key = random 5-letter key
Output = unique ciphertext.

**Why Unbreakable:**

* The key is completely random and as long as the message.
* Every possible plaintext is equally likely; no statistical relationship exists between ciphertext and plaintext.
* Even with infinite computing power, without the key the ciphertext cannot be decrypted.

**Condition:**
For true security, the key must be:

1. Truly random.
2. Used only once.
3. Kept completely secret.

**Example:**
If Plaintext = `A (0)` and Key = `K (10)` → Cipher = (0+10) mod 26 = `K`.
Decryption simply reverses it using the same key.

➡️ Thus, OTP is **theoretically unbreakable**, though impractical for everyday use due to key distribution challenges.
