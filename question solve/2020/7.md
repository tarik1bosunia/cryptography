## Question 7 Answers

### (a) What is IP Security? Explain the Role of IPSec in the Routing Architecture.

**IP Security (IPSec):**
IPSec is a suite of protocols that provides **secure communication** at the IP layer by authenticating and encrypting each IP packet. It ensures **confidentiality, integrity, and authentication** in network communications.

**Role in Routing Architecture:**

1. **Secures Data at the Network Layer:**
   Works directly with IP packets—protects all upper-layer protocols (TCP, UDP, etc.) without requiring modification.
2. **Modes of Operation:**

   * **Transport Mode:** Encrypts only the payload of the IP packet (used for end-to-end communication between hosts).
   * **Tunnel Mode:** Encrypts both header and payload (used between gateways or routers in VPNs).
3. **Protocols Used:**

   * **AH (Authentication Header):** Provides integrity and authentication.
   * **ESP (Encapsulating Security Payload):** Provides encryption and integrity.
4. **Integration in Routing:**

   * IPSec can be integrated into routers and gateways to create **Virtual Private Networks (VPNs)**.
   * Secure tunnels between routers ensure safe data flow over public networks.

**Example:**
A branch office router connects securely to the head office router via an IPSec tunnel — even if the Internet path is insecure, packets remain protected.

### (b) Explain Different Types of Intruders with Example

An **intruder** is an unauthorized person or program attempting to gain access to a system or network.

**Types of Intruders:**

1. **Masquerader:**

   * External attacker pretending to be an authorized user.
   * *Example:* Hacker logging in using a stolen username and password.

2. **Misfeasor:**

   * Legitimate user who misuses their privileges.
   * *Example:* An employee accessing confidential HR data without authorization.

3. **Clandestine User:**

   * Gains administrative (root) control and hides activities from auditing systems.
   * *Example:* Malware gaining admin privileges and disabling security logs.

**Summary:**
Masquerader → outsider attack; Misfeasor → insider misuse; Clandestine user → stealth admin control.

### (c) How to Learn (Crack) Passwords? Explain

Password learning or **password cracking** refers to techniques used to recover passwords, either for security testing or malicious purposes.

**Common Methods:**

1. **Dictionary Attack:**
   Uses a list of common passwords or dictionary words to guess the correct one.
2. **Brute Force Attack:**
   Tries every possible combination of characters until the correct password is found.
3. **Rainbow Table Attack:**
   Uses precomputed hash tables to reverse-engineer passwords from their hash values.
4. **Social Engineering:**
   Exploiting human behavior to trick users into revealing their passwords.
5. **Keylogging or Malware:**
   Captures keystrokes to steal passwords in real time.

**Protection Techniques:**

* Use strong, complex passwords (mix of letters, numbers, and symbols).
* Implement two-factor authentication (2FA).
* Hash and salt passwords before storing them.
* Educate users about phishing and social engineering.

**Example:**
If a system stores passwords as MD5 hashes, an attacker may use rainbow tables to reverse them. Using **salted hashes** makes such attacks computationally impractical.

**Conclusion:**
Password learning helps understand weaknesses, but in cybersecurity, it should only be used ethically — for testing and strengthening system defenses.
