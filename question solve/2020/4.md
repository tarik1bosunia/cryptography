## Question 4 Answers

### (a) What is a One-Way Hash Function? Briefly Discuss MD5

**One-Way Hash Function:**
A one-way hash function takes an input message of any length and produces a fixed-length output called a **message digest**. It is computationally infeasible to reverse (i.e., find the original message from its hash) or to find two different messages that produce the same hash value.

**Properties:**

* **Preimage resistance:** Hard to find a message from its hash.
* **Second preimage resistance:** Hard to find another message with the same hash.
* **Collision resistance:** Hard to find any two messages with the same hash.

**MD5 (Message Digest 5):**

* Developed by **Ron Rivest**.
* Produces a **128-bit (16-byte)** hash.
* The message is divided into 512-bit blocks.
* Each block undergoes **four rounds** of transformation using bitwise operations, modular addition, and nonlinear functions (F, G, H, I).
* Final output is a 128-bit digest represented as a 32-character hexadecimal string.

**Example:**
MD5("HELLO") = `8b1a9953c4611296a827abf8c47804d7`

*Note:* MD5 is no longer secure for cryptographic purposes but is still used for checksums and integrity verification.

### (b) RSA Encryption and Decryption Example

**Given:**
`n = 3337`, `e = 79`, `d = 1019`
Message `m = 010567890987`

#### Step 1: Split Message into Blocks

Since `m < n` must hold for RSA, split into 3-digit blocks:

```
010 | 567 | 890 | 987
```

Convert to integers: [10, 567, 890, 987]

#### Step 2: Encrypt Each Block

Formula: `C = M^e mod n`

| Block |  M  | C = M^e mod 3337 |
| :---: | :-: | :--------------: |
|   1   |  10 |       3269       |
|   2   | 567 |       2555       |
|   3   | 890 |       1722       |
|   4   | 987 |       3290       |

**Encrypted Message:**
`3269 2555 1722 3290`

#### Step 3: Decrypt Each Block

Formula: `M = C^d mod n`

| Block |   C  | M = C^d mod 3337 |
| :---: | :--: | :--------------: |
|   1   | 3269 |        10        |
|   2   | 2555 |        567       |
|   3   | 1722 |        890       |
|   4   | 3290 |        987       |

**Decrypted Message:**
`010567890987`

✅ **Verified:** The decrypted message is equal to the original message.

### Summary

* **Hash (MD5)** provides message integrity verification.
* **RSA** ensures secure transmission — encryption and decryption with public/private key pairs.

**Final Answer:**
RSA decryption restores the exact original message, confirming correctness of the public-key algorithm.
