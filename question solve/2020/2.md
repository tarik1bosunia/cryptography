## Question 2 Answers (Set 2)

### (a) What is a Digital Signature? Discuss Signing Techniques

A **digital signature** is an electronic equivalent of a handwritten signature that ensures the authenticity, integrity, and non-repudiation of a message. It is generated using cryptographic methods.

#### (i) Symmetric Cryptosystems and an Arbitrator

* In symmetric systems, both sender and receiver share the same secret key.
* Since the same key is used, there’s no direct way to prove who created the message — so an **arbitrator** (trusted third party) is introduced.

**Procedure:**

1. Sender encrypts the message using their secret key and sends it to the arbitrator.
2. Arbitrator decrypts the message, verifies authenticity, and re-encrypts it using the receiver’s key.
3. Receiver decrypts it and trusts the message’s validity because it passed through the arbitrator.

**Advantages:** Simple and fast using symmetric ciphers (e.g., DES, AES).
**Disadvantages:** Requires a trusted arbitrator and secure key exchange.

#### (ii) Public-Key Cryptography

* Each user has a **public key** (shared) and a **private key** (kept secret).
* The sender signs the message using their **private key**.
* The receiver verifies the signature using the sender’s **public key**.

**Process:**

1. Compute hash of message → `H(M)`.
2. Encrypt hash using sender’s private key → Signature `S = E(PR_A, H(M))`.
3. Send message + signature.
4. Receiver decrypts signature using public key → `D(PU_A, S)` and compares with hash of received message.

**Example:**
If Alice sends a message to Bob, Bob verifies that only Alice could have signed it (since only she has her private key).

### (b) Password Strength Calculation (DES Encryption)

**Given:** 6-byte alphanumeric password (A–Z, a–z, 0–9) → 62 possible characters.
**Password length:** 6 bytes → total combinations = 62⁶.

```
62⁶ = 56,800,235,584 combinations ≈ 5.68 × 10¹⁰
```

If 1 machine performs **1 billion attempts/sec (10⁹/sec)**:

```
Time to crack = (5.68 × 10¹⁰) / (10⁹) = 56.8 seconds
≈ 1 minute
```

**Average time to succeed (half search space):** ≈ 28.4 seconds.

✅ **Therefore:** It would take roughly **30 seconds** on average to break such a password — meaning 6-character passwords are extremely weak.

### (c) What is Key Crunching? Why is Passphrase Important?

**Key Crunching:**
The process of converting a user’s password or passphrase into a cryptographic key suitable for encryption. This often involves:

* Hashing the password repeatedly (e.g., PBKDF2, bcrypt).
* Expanding it to the required key length for algorithms like DES or AES.

**Importance of Passphrase:**

* A **passphrase** (longer, more complex string) is much harder to guess or brute-force than a short password.
* It increases entropy and resists dictionary attacks.
* Example: `myDogRunsAt5amEveryday!` → far stronger than `dog123`.

**Conclusion:**
Using strong passphrases and secure key derivation (key crunching) greatly improves encryption strength and overall system security.
