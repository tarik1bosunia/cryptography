## Question 8 Answers

### (a) Briefly Explain the Following Terms

**(i) Trap Doors:**
Also known as **backdoors**, these are hidden entry points intentionally left in software by developers to bypass normal authentication or security checks. They can be used for debugging or maintenance but may be exploited by attackers.

*Example:* A programmer inserts a secret login command to access the system without proper authentication.

**(ii) Logic Bomb:**
A piece of malicious code inserted into a program that triggers a harmful action when specific conditions are met, such as a date or event.

*Example:* A logic bomb that deletes files if an employeeâ€™s name is removed from the payroll database.

**(iii) Trojan Horse:**
A malicious program disguised as legitimate software. When executed, it performs harmful activities like stealing information or installing malware.

*Example:* A fake antivirus software that installs spyware when run.

### (b) What is a Firewall? Briefly Discuss Application-Level Gateway Firewall

**Firewall:**
A firewall is a network security device that monitors and controls incoming and outgoing traffic based on predefined security rules. It acts as a barrier between a trusted internal network and an untrusted external one (like the Internet).

**Types of Firewalls:**

1. Packet-filtering firewall
2. Stateful inspection firewall
3. Application-level gateway (proxy firewall)
4. Circuit-level gateway

**Application-Level Gateway (Proxy Firewall):**

* Operates at the **application layer (Layer 7)** of the OSI model.
* Filters traffic for specific applications such as HTTP, FTP, SMTP.
* Inspects packet content instead of just headers, offering **deep packet inspection**.
* Masks internal user IPs by serving as an intermediary between client and server.

**Example:** A proxy server that checks web traffic for malicious scripts before forwarding it to the user.

**Advantages:**

* Provides detailed logging and user control.
* Prevents direct connections between internal and external systems.

**Disadvantages:**

* Slower due to content inspection.
* Requires configuration for each supported application.

### (c) Techniques to Control Access and Enforce Site Security Policy

1. **Access Control Lists (ACLs):** Define who can access what resources and under what conditions.
2. **Authentication:** Verify user identity using passwords, biometrics, or multi-factor authentication.
3. **Authorization:** Determine permissions and privileges for authenticated users.
4. **Encryption:** Protect data in transit and at rest to prevent eavesdropping.
5. **Auditing and Logging:** Record access attempts and system activities for accountability.
6. **Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems (IDPS):** Detect and block malicious behavior.
7. **Security Policies:** Establish organizational rules for password usage, network behavior, and data protection.

**Summary:**
Effective access control combines strong authentication, role-based authorization, continuous monitoring, and well-defined security policies to protect network resources.
