# Security Question 8 Solutions

---

## 8(a) 11 simple, actionable steps to keep your system protected

1. **Keep everything updated (auto‑patch).** Turn on automatic updates for the OS, browsers, drivers, and apps. Patch Java, PDF readers, Office, and firmware (BIOS/router). Most real‑world breaches exploit old bugs.
2. **Use strong, unique passwords with a manager.** Create a long master password (passphrase) and store all others in a reputable password manager. Turn on password breach alerts.
3. **Enable multi‑factor authentication (MFA).** Prefer an authenticator app or hardware key over SMS. Require MFA for e‑mail, cloud drives, code repos, and banking.
4. **Turn on full‑disk encryption + auto‑lock.** Use BitLocker (Windows), FileVault (macOS), or LUKS (Linux). Set short screen‑lock timeouts and require a password at boot. Keep recovery keys offline.
5. **Back up with the 3‑2‑1 rule.** Three copies, two different media, one off‑site (cloud or offline). Use versioned backups and occasionally perform a test restore.
6. **Harden your network/Wi‑Fi.** Update the router, change default admin password, use WPA3/WPA2‑AES (never WEP), disable WPS, separate guest IoT devices, and consider DNS filtering (e.g., Quad9/Cloudflare).
7. **Run endpoint protection and the firewall.** Keep Windows Defender or another reputable AV/EDR enabled. Leave OS firewalls on. Block inbound by default and allow only what you need.
8. **Practice safe browsing.** Keep browsers auto‑updated, use HTTPS‑Only, limit extensions, enable download scanning, and consider an ad/tracker blocker. Use separate browser profiles for work/personal to reduce cross‑site risk.
9. **Least privilege + app hygiene.** Use a standard (non‑admin) account daily, elevate only when needed. Install software from trusted stores, remove unused apps, and disable autorun/macros by default.
10. **Phishing and social‑engineering defense.** Verify sender addresses and links, hover before clicking, be skeptical of urgency/payment/gift cards, and never enter credentials on pages delivered via e‑mail links without checking the domain.
11. **Monitoring and incident readiness.** Turn on account‑sign‑in alerts, keep logs, enable device‑finding/remote‑wipe, and maintain a short checklist for lost device, malware infection, and password resets.

> Bonus tips: on public Wi‑Fi, avoid sensitive activity or use a trusted VPN; keep a separate non‑admin user for kids/guests; consider hardware security keys (FIDO2) for your most critical accounts.

## 8(b) Encryption software/tools to protect data (with when to use each)

* **Full‑disk encryption (protects entire drive at rest):**

  * *BitLocker* (Windows Pro/Enterprise) or *Device Encryption* (Windows Home)
  * *FileVault* (macOS)
  * *LUKS/dm‑crypt* (Linux)
  * *Mobile:* iOS and modern Android encrypt storage by default
  * *Use when:* protecting laptops/phones from loss/theft; requires pre‑boot auth.

* **File/Folder encryption (selective, cross‑platform):**

  * *VeraCrypt* — containers or whole partitions; good for USBs.
  * *Cryptomator* — client‑side encryption for cloud folders (Google Drive, OneDrive, Dropbox).
  * *7‑Zip/Zip with AES‑256* — quick encrypted archives for sharing; use strong passwords and “encrypt file names”.
  * *age / rage* or *GnuPG (GPG)* — encrypt/sign individual files; script‑friendly and audit‑able.
  * *Use when:* sharing files, securing cloud‑synced data, or transporting data on removable media.

* **Backups with built‑in encryption:**

  * *Time Machine* (with FileVault), *Windows Backup*, *restic*, *BorgBackup*.
  * *Use when:* storing backups off‑site/cloud while keeping them confidential.

* **Communication encryption:**

  * *Signal* (end‑to‑end messaging/voice), *PGP/GPG* for e‑mail signing/encryption.

* **Hardware‑encrypted drives:**

  * USB SSD/HDD with on‑device PIN keypad (e.g., IronKey). Useful for highly portable data.

**Choosing guide:** match the tool to your threat model; favor open standards, modern ciphers (AES‑256, ChaCha20‑Poly1305), and keep keys/recovery codes in a safe place.

## 8(c) Differentiate among Trap door, Logic bomb, and Trojan horse

| Term                     | Short definition                                            | Typical behavior                                                                                    | Example                                                       | Defense                                                                 |
| ------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Trap door (Backdoor)** | Hidden bypass around normal authentication/controls         | Allows covert access/control; can be intentional (vendor support) or malicious                      | Hard‑coded admin password or secret API key in code           | Code reviews, secret scanning, remove default creds, network monitoring |
| **Logic bomb**           | Dormant code that triggers on a specific **condition/time** | Executes a payload when criteria met (date, username, file deleted)                                 | Insider plants code to wipe files if user account is disabled | Version control reviews, change management, integrity monitoring        |
| **Trojan horse**         | Malware **disguised as legitimate software**                | User is tricked into installing it; then it steals data, installs backdoors, or drops other malware | “Free” cracked app that installs a remote‑access tool (RAT)   | Allow‑listing, signed installers, AV/EDR, user training                 |

**Key idea:** Trojans trick users at install time; logic bombs hide and wait; backdoors deliberately bypass controls.
