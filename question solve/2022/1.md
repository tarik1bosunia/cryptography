# Cryptography Question Solutions

## Q1(a) What is restricted algorithm? What are the drawbacks of restricted algorithm?

**Restricted Algorithm:**

* A restricted algorithm is a cryptographic system where the secrecy of the algorithm itself (not the key) is expected to provide security.
* Example: Early substitution ciphers where the algorithm itself was kept secret.

**Drawbacks:**

1. **Kerckhoffs’s Principle Violation** – Security should depend only on the secrecy of the key, not the algorithm.
2. **Difficult to Maintain Secrecy** – Once the algorithm is exposed, the whole system collapses.
3. **Lack of Flexibility** – Same algorithm cannot be used widely; secrecy must be maintained for each user group.
4. **No Standardization** – Each system may use a different hidden algorithm, making interoperability impossible.

## Q1(b) Caesar Cipher then Transposition Cipher

**Plaintext:**

```
COMPUTER SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING
```

### Step 1: Caesar Cipher (Shift = 3)

* Replace each character by the character 3 places to the right (A→D, B→E, …, Z→C).
* Leave spaces unchanged.

**Ciphertext after Caesar:**

```
FRPSXWHU VFLHQFH DQG HQJLQHHULQJ
```

### Step 2: Transposition Cipher (Width = 5)

Write the ciphertext row by row in a matrix of 5 columns:

```
F R P S X
W H U V F
L F L H Q
F H D Q G
H Q J L Q
H H U L Q
J
```

Now read column by column (top to bottom, left to right):

**Final Ciphertext:**

```
FWLFHJ RHLQMP PUDDJ SVIQJL XFCGQH

## Q1(c) Differentiate between symmetric and asymmetric encryption

| Feature       | Symmetric Encryption                               | Asymmetric Encryption                            |
| ------------- | -------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| **Key Used**  | Single key (same for encryption & decryption)      | Two keys: Public key & Private key               |
| **Speed**     | Faster, suitable for large data                    | Slower due to complex mathematics                |
| **Security**  | Key must be shared secretly (risk of interception) | More secure as private key is never shared       |
| **Examples**  | AES, DES, RC4                                      | RSA, ECC, Diffie-Hellman                         |
| **Use Cases** | Bulk data encryption, storage security             | Digital signatures, key exchange, authentication |
