# Cryptography Question 2 Solutions

---

## Q2(a) What is birthday attack? Discuss the birthday attack against one-way hash function.

**Birthday Attack:**

* The birthday attack is a cryptographic attack that exploits the mathematics of the birthday paradox in probability theory.
* It is used to find collisions in hash functions, i.e., two different inputs producing the same hash value.

**Against One-Way Hash Function:**

* A hash function with an `n`-bit output has `2^n` possible hash values.
* Due to the birthday paradox, a collision can be expected after about `2^(n/2)` random inputs.
* Example: For a 64-bit hash, instead of `2^64` attempts, only about `2^32` attempts are needed to find a collision.
* This reduces the effective strength of hash functions, making longer outputs (like SHA-256 with 128-bit collision resistance) necessary in practice.

## Q2(b) Password cracking with 6-byte alphanumeric password (DES)

* Alphanumeric characters = 26 (uppercase) + 26 (lowercase) + 10 (digits) = **62 characters**.

* Password length = 6 characters.

* Total possible passwords:

  $$
  62^6 = 56,800,235,584 \; \approx 5.68 \times 10^{10}
  $$

* On average, attacker needs half the space:

  $$
  56,800,235,584 / 2 \approx 2.84 \times 10^{10}
  $$

* Machine speed = **1 billion attempts/sec** = $10^9$ attempts/sec.

* Time required:

  $$
  \frac{2.84 \times 10^{10}}{10^9} = 28.4 \; seconds
  $$

**Answer:** It would take about **28.4 seconds on average** to break the 6-character alphanumeric DES password using a machine capable of 1 billion attempts per second.

## Q2(c) Prime numbers generation technique in real world

**Prime Number Generation Techniques:**

1. **Randomized Generation:** Generate a large random number of required bit length (e.g., 1024 bits for RSA).
2. **Primality Testing:** Apply probabilistic primality tests like:

   * **Miller–Rabin Test** (fast and widely used).
   * **Fermat Test** (simpler but weaker).
   * **AKS Algorithm** (deterministic but slower for very large numbers).
3. **Iterative Process:** Keep generating random numbers and test until a prime is found.
4. **Safe Primes for Cryptography:** Sometimes generate primes such that `(p-1)/2` is also prime (used in Diffie-Hellman, DSA).

**Real-World Usage:**

* RSA, Diffie-Hellman, and ECC rely on large prime numbers (hundreds to thousands of bits).
* Cryptographic libraries (like OpenSSL) use efficient prime generation with Miller–Rabin for practical security.
