### (a) Key features of Rivest Cipher (RC5)

* Designed by **Ronald Rivest** in 1994.
* Symmetric block cipher with **variable parameters**:

  * Block size: 32, 64, or 128 bits
  * Key size: 0–2040 bits
  * Rounds: 0–255
* Uses simple operations: **XOR, addition, and data-dependent rotation**.
* Efficient in both hardware and software.
* Resistant to differential and linear cryptanalysis due to data-dependent rotations.
* Highly flexible—can be tuned for performance or security.

### (b) What is Rivest–Shamir–Adleman (RSA)?

RSA is a **public-key cryptosystem** based on the difficulty of factoring large integers. It provides both encryption and digital signatures.

**Main Steps:**

1. Choose two large primes `p` and `q`.
2. Compute `n = p × q` and Euler’s totient `φ(n) = (p−1)(q−1)`.
3. Choose public exponent `e` (1 < e < φ(n), gcd(e, φ(n)) = 1).
4. Compute private exponent `d` such that `e×d ≡ 1 (mod φ(n))`.

**Encryption:** `C = M^e mod n`
**Decryption:** `M = C^d mod n`

### (c) RSA Example

Given: `p = 5`, `q = 7`, `e = 11`.

**Step 1:** Compute `n = 5×7 = 35` and `φ(n) = (5−1)(7−1) = 24`.

**Step 2:** Find `d` such that `11×d ≡ 1 (mod 24)` → `d = 11` (since 11×11 = 121 ≡ 1 mod 24).

**Step 3:** Public key = (e=11, n=35), Private key = (d=11, n=35).

**Encryption:**
Message `M = 123456789` must be split into blocks < 35.
Let’s take one block `M = 12` (for simplicity).

```
C = 12^11 mod 35 = 17
```

**Decryption:**

```
M = 17^11 mod 35 = 12
```

✅ Verified — original message recovered.

### (a) How can you generate a longer hash value than a given hash function produces?

* Apply **hash chaining**: concatenate multiple hash outputs of the same message with different salts or counters.
* Use **HMAC** or **HKDF** (key derivation functions) to expand hash size.
* Combine multiple hash algorithms (e.g., SHA-256 + SHA-512) and concatenate results.

Example: For 128-bit MD5 → compute `H1 = MD5(m‖0)`, `H2 = MD5(m‖1)` → combine: `H = H1‖H2` = 256 bits.

### (b) Compare Message Digest (MD5) and Secure Hash Algorithm (SHA)

|   Feature   |              MD5             |              SHA (SHA-1/SHA-2)             |
| :---------: | :--------------------------: | :----------------------------------------: |
|  Developer  |       Ron Rivest (1991)      |         NIST (1993, updated 2001+)         |
| Output size |           128 bits           | SHA-1: 160 bits; SHA-256/512: 256–512 bits |
|   Security  | Broken (collisions possible) |           SHA-2 currently secure           |
|    Speed    |            Faster            |       Slightly slower but more secure      |
|    Usage    |   Checksums, legacy systems  |   Digital signatures, SSL/TLS, blockchain  |

### (c) Kerberos Credentials

**Main credentials in Kerberos:**

1. **Ticket Granting Ticket (TGT):**

   * Issued by Authentication Server (AS) after login.
   * Used to obtain service tickets without re-entering credentials.
2. **Service Ticket:**

   * Issued by TGS for access to specific network services.
3. **Session Key:**

   * Shared secret key for secure client-server communication.
4. **Authenticator:**

   * Time-stamped proof of identity to prevent replay attacks.

### (a) Public-Key Distribution Techniques

**(i) Publicly Available Directory:**

* A directory maintained by a trusted authority containing `(UserID, PublicKey)` pairs.
* Users can query the directory to obtain others’ public keys.
* Requires protection from tampering and impersonation (e.g., digitally signed responses).

**(ii) Public-Key Certificates:**

* Certificates bind an entity’s identity to its public key using a **Certificate Authority (CA)**.
* Format: `(UserID, PublicKey, Validity, Signature_CA)`.
* Recipients verify the CA’s signature to ensure authenticity.

### (b) PGP Confidentiality Service (Neat Diagram)

**Pretty Good Privacy (PGP):** A hybrid system combining symmetric encryption and public-key cryptography for email security.

**Steps:**

1. Generate random session key `K_s`.
2. Encrypt message `M` using symmetric cipher (e.g., AES): `C = Enc_{K_s}(M)`.
3. Encrypt `K_s` with receiver’s public key: `E_s = Enc_{PU_R}(K_s)`.
4. Send both `(E_s, C)`.

**On decryption:** Receiver uses private key to get `K_s`, then decrypts message.

**Diagram:**

```
Sender:  M → Encrypt(K_s) → C
          K_s → Encrypt(PU_R) → E_s
Send: [E_s, C]
Receiver: Decrypt(SK_R)(E_s) → K_s → Decrypt(K_s)(C) → M
```

**Result:** Confidentiality ensured through hybrid encryption.

### (c) What is Internet Protocol (IP) Security?

**IPSec:** A set of protocols providing security at the IP layer.

* **Functions:** Authentication, integrity, encryption, and replay protection.
* **Components:**

  * **AH (Authentication Header):** Verifies origin & integrity.
  * **ESP (Encapsulating Security Payload):** Provides confidentiality.
* **Modes:**

  * **Transport Mode:** End-to-end protection between hosts.
  * **Tunnel Mode:** Entire IP packet encrypted (used in VPNs).

### (a) What is a Firewall? Strength and Weakness

**Firewall:** A network security device that filters traffic based on security policies.

**Strengths:**

* Monitors and controls traffic.
* Prevents unauthorized access.
* Acts as first line of defense.

**Weaknesses:**

* Cannot protect against insider attacks.
* Ineffective if traffic bypasses it (e.g., encrypted malicious payloads).
* Needs regular updates to stay effective.

### (b) Different Threats on the Web

1. **Phishing:** Fake emails/websites steal credentials.
2. **SQL Injection:** Malicious queries manipulate databases.
3. **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Injects harmful scripts into websites.
4. **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM):** Attacker intercepts data between client and server.
5. **Malware/Ransomware:** Infects systems to steal or lock data.

### (c) R64 Conversion (Radix-64) and Its Use

* Converts binary data to printable ASCII text for email compatibility.
* Each 3 bytes (24 bits) → 4 ASCII characters.
* Used in PGP and MIME to send encrypted or binary attachments via email systems that only support text.

**Example:** Binary `01001101 01000100 01000101` (MDE) → Base64 encoded string `TURF`.

**Advantages:**

* Ensures data integrity in transit.
* Compatible with legacy mail gateways.

**Hence,** R64 enables encrypted messages and files to be transmitted safely through text-based email systems.
