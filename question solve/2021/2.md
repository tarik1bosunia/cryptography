|         Feature        |             Symmetric Cryptography            |                      Public-Key Cryptography                     |                             Hybrid Cryptography                            |
| :--------------------: | :-------------------------------------------: | :--------------------------------------------------------------: | :------------------------------------------------------------------------: |
|      **Keys Used**     | Single key (same for encryption & decryption) |                    Two keys (public & private)                   |                Combination of both symmetric and public-key                |
|        **Speed**       |                   Very fast                   |                        Comparatively slow                        | Balanced – uses symmetric for speed and public-key for secure key exchange |
|      **Security**      |       Depends on keeping the key secret       | Security based on mathematical hardness (e.g., factoring primes) |                  Highly secure; combines benefits of both                  |
| **Example Algorithms** |                 AES, DES, RC4                 |                           RSA, ECC, DSA                          |                                SSL/TLS, PGP                                |

**Summary:**
Symmetric is efficient but needs secure key sharing, public-key is secure but slow, and hybrid cryptography combines both for practical secure communication.

### (b) Briefly discuss the terms

**(i) Poor Key Choice:**
Choosing easily guessable or predictable keys (like “12345”, “password”) weakens encryption and makes brute-force attacks easier.

**(ii) Random Keys:**
Keys generated using true randomness (hardware RNG or cryptographically secure PRNG) ensure unpredictability and strong protection against attacks.

**(iii) Pass Phrases:**
Instead of a short password, a longer meaningful phrase (e.g., “MyDogRunsAt5AM!”) can serve as a secure key. They are easier to remember but hard to guess.

**(iv) Updating Keys:**
Regularly changing encryption keys reduces the risk of key compromise and prevents attackers from using old keys to decrypt new data.

### (c) Importance of Updating Keys & Effect of Poor Key Choice

**Importance of Updating Keys:**

* Reduces exposure if a key is leaked.
* Prevents long-term attacks like replay or brute-force attacks.
* Maintains forward secrecy in secure communication systems.

**Effect of Poor Key Choice:**

* Makes the system vulnerable to dictionary and brute-force attacks.
* Compromises overall data confidentiality even if encryption algorithms are strong.

➡️ **Conclusion:** Secure, random, and regularly updated keys are essential for maintaining robust cryptographic security.
