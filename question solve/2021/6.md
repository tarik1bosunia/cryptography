## Question 6 Answers

### (a) Why is PGP now widely used?

**PGP (Pretty Good Privacy)** is widely used because it provides a practical, reliable, and secure way to ensure **confidentiality, authentication, integrity, and non-repudiation** in digital communication.

**Reasons for popularity:**

* Uses a **hybrid encryption system** combining the speed of symmetric cryptography and the security of public-key cryptography.
* Provides **end-to-end encryption** for e-mails, files, and digital signatures.
* Is **open-source** and platform-independent, with many implementations available (e.g., GPG).
* Enables **trust-based key management** through the “web of trust” model rather than centralized certification.
* Ensures that even if intercepted, data remains unreadable without the private key.

### (b) Services of PGP

#### (i) Compression

Before encryption, PGP compresses the message using algorithms like ZIP. This:

* Reduces transmission time and storage.
* Increases cryptographic strength by reducing patterns and redundancy in plaintext.

#### (ii) E-mail Compatibility

Encrypted binary data may not be compatible with text-only e-mail systems. PGP converts encrypted binary data into **ASCII text** using **Radix-64 encoding (Base64)**, making it suitable for e-mail transmission.

#### (iii) Segmentation and Reassembly

When messages are too large for email transport or file limits, PGP:

* **Segments** the encrypted data into smaller parts before sending.
* The receiver then **reassembles** the segments automatically after decryption.

### (c) Applications of IPSec

**IPSec (Internet Protocol Security)** is a suite of protocols used to secure IP communications through encryption and authentication.

**Main Applications:**

1. **Virtual Private Networks (VPNs):** Provides secure remote access and site-to-site tunnels over the Internet.
2. **Secure Data Transfer:** Protects data integrity and confidentiality in IP packets.
3. **End-to-End Security:** Used between hosts for secure communications (e.g., client–server).
4. **Gateway Security:** Protects routers, firewalls, and gateways from packet tampering or spoofing.
5. **Enterprise Networks:** Ensures secure communication between branch offices and data centers.

**In summary:** IPSec enables secure, authenticated, and encrypted IP-level communication, forming the foundation of most modern VPN systems.
