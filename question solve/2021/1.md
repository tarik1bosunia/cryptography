## Question 1 Answers

### (a) What is meant by Authentication, Integrity and Nonrepudiation?

**Authentication:**
Ensures that the sender and receiver of a message are genuine. It verifies the identity of the communicating parties. For example, a digital signature or password-based system provides authentication.

**Integrity:**
Guarantees that the data has not been altered or tampered with during transmission. Techniques like cryptographic hash functions (e.g., SHA-256) ensure message integrity.

**Nonrepudiation:**
Prevents a sender from denying that they sent a message. Digital signatures provide nonrepudiation by binding the sender’s identity to the message.

### (b) Discuss in brief the following cryptanalytic attacks

**i. Ciphertext-only attack:**
In this attack, the attacker has access only to the ciphertext (encrypted text) and attempts to deduce the plaintext or the encryption key. It relies on statistical analysis and frequency patterns of the ciphertext.

**ii. Adaptive Chosen-Plaintext attack:**
The attacker can choose plaintexts and obtain their corresponding ciphertexts. Based on the results, they adaptively choose new plaintexts to gain more information about the encryption key. This attack is very powerful against poorly designed encryption schemes.

**iii. Rubber-hose attack:**
This is a non-technical attack where the attacker physically coerces (e.g., by threats or force) the key holder to reveal the encryption key or password. It exploits human vulnerability rather than algorithmic weakness.

### (c) One-time Pad Encryption

**Given:**
Key sequence (from pad): `ARPFUTHSNH`
Plaintext: `BANGLADESH`

Each letter is converted to a number (A=0, B=1, ..., Z=25).

| Letter | Plaintext | Value | Key | Value | Cipher = (P + K) mod 26 | Cipher Letter |
| :----: | :-------: | :---: | :-: | :---: | :---------------------: | :-----------: |
|    1   |     B     |   1   |  A  |   0   |         (1+0)=1         |       B       |
|    2   |     A     |   0   |  R  |   17  |        (0+17)=17        |       R       |
|    3   |     N     |   13  |  P  |   15  |       (13+15)=28→2      |       C       |
|    4   |     G     |   6   |  F  |   5   |         (6+5)=11        |       L       |
|    5   |     L     |   11  |  U  |   20  |       (11+20)=31→5      |       F       |
|    6   |     A     |   0   |  T  |   19  |        (0+19)=19        |       T       |
|    7   |     D     |   3   |  H  |   7   |         (3+7)=10        |       K       |
|    8   |     E     |   4   |  S  |   18  |        (4+18)=22        |       W       |
|    9   |     S     |   18  |  N  |   13  |       (18+13)=31→5      |       F       |
|   10   |     H     |   7   |  H  |   7   |         (7+7)=14        |       O       |

**Encrypted Message:** `BRCLFTKWFO`

**Decryption:**
To decrypt, subtract the key value from ciphertext value (mod 26):
`Plaintext = (Cipher - Key) mod 26`

Decrypted text = **BANGLADESH** ✅
