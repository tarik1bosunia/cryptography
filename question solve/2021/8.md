## Question 8 Answers

### (a) What is a Digital Signature? Describe Direct Digital Signature.

**Digital Signature:**
A **digital signature** is a cryptographic technique used to verify the authenticity, integrity, and non-repudiation of a digital message or document. It ensures that the message has not been altered and that it was sent by the genuine sender.

**Process:**

1. The sender generates a **hash (message digest)** of the message using a hashing algorithm (e.g., SHA-256).
2. The hash is then **encrypted with the sender’s private key** to create the digital signature.
3. The signature is sent along with the message.
4. The receiver **decrypts the signature using the sender’s public key** and compares the resulting hash with their own computed hash of the received message.

   * If both match → message is authentic.

**Direct Digital Signature:**

* Created by the sender using only their **private key**, without involving any third party (like a certification authority).
* Suitable when both parties directly trust each other.
* **Limitation:** If the sender denies signing the message, it is difficult to prove authenticity without a trusted third party.

**Example:**
If Alice sends a signed message to Bob:
`Signature = Encrypt(Hash(Message), PrivateKey_Alice)`
Bob verifies using `Decrypt(Signature, PublicKey_Alice)`.

### (b) MD5 Algorithm for Message Authentication

**MD5 (Message Digest Algorithm 5)** is a widely used hash function designed by **Ron Rivest**. It produces a **128-bit (16-byte)** message digest from input data of any length.

**Steps:**

1. **Padding:** The original message is padded to make its length ≡ 448 mod 512 bits.
2. **Appending Length:** The 64-bit representation of the original message length is appended.
3. **Initialization:** Four 32-bit buffers (A, B, C, D) are initialized with fixed values.
4. **Processing Blocks:** The message is divided into 512-bit blocks, and each block is processed through **four rounds** using nonlinear functions (F, G, H, I), bitwise operations, and modular addition.
5. **Output:** The concatenation of A, B, C, and D after processing all blocks forms the final 128-bit hash value.

**Example Output:**
Input: “HELLO” → MD5: `8b1a9953c4611296a827abf8c47804d7`

**Uses:**

* Message integrity verification.
* Password hashing (though now considered insecure for cryptographic use).

### (c) Difference between Trapdoors and Logic Bombs

|   **Feature**  | **Trapdoor (Backdoor)**                                                                             | **Logic Bomb**                                                                                            |
| :------------: | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Definition** | A hidden entry point intentionally built into software to bypass normal authentication or security. | Malicious code inserted into a program that executes a harmful function when specific conditions are met. |
|   **Purpose**  | Often used for maintenance or unauthorized access.                                                  | Designed to cause damage or data loss when triggered.                                                     |
|   **Trigger**  | Can be accessed anytime by the attacker.                                                            | Activated only when a certain event or date occurs.                                                       |
|   **Example**  | Developer leaves a secret admin login in an application.                                            | Code that deletes files on a specific date.                                                               |

**Summary:**
Trapdoors focus on **unauthorized access**, while logic bombs focus on **destructive behavior** triggered under specific conditions.
