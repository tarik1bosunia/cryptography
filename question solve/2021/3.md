## Question 3 Answers

### (a) RC5 Block Cipher (for 64-bit data block)

**Introduction:**
RC5 is a symmetric-key block cipher algorithm designed by **Ronald Rivest** in 1994. It is known for its simplicity, speed, and flexibility.

**Key Features:**

* **Block size (w):** 32, 64, or 128 bits
* **Key size:** 0 to 2040 bits
* **Number of rounds (r):** 0 to 255 (typically 12 or 20)

**Structure for 64-bit data block:**

* Data block: 64 bits divided into two 32-bit halves (A and B).
* Key expansion generates **subkeys S[0...2r+1]**.

**Steps:**

1. **Key Expansion:** The secret key is expanded into an array of subkeys using a predefined constant.
2. **Encryption:**
   For each round *i* (1 ≤ i ≤ r):

   ```
   A = ((A ⊕ B) <<< B) + S[2i]  
   B = ((B ⊕ A) <<< A) + S[2i + 1]
   ```

   where `<<<` means left rotation.
3. **Decryption:** Performs the inverse operations in reverse order.

**Characteristics:**

* Data-dependent rotations make RC5 resistant to differential and linear cryptanalysis.
* The simplicity of operations (XOR, addition, rotation) allows efficient hardware and software implementation.

### (b) How can you generate a longer hash value than a given hash function produces?

If a hash function (like SHA-256) produces a fixed-length output, you can generate longer hash values by:

* **Hash chaining:** Apply the hash function multiple times with different salts or counters and concatenate the results.
* **Using HMAC or HKDF:** Derive longer keys or digests using standard key derivation functions that extend hash outputs.
* **Combining multiple hash functions:** Use several hash functions (e.g., SHA-256 + SHA-512) and concatenate their outputs.

### (c) What is RSA?

**RSA (Rivest–Shamir–Adleman)** is a **public-key cryptosystem** used for secure data transmission and digital signatures.

**Key Concepts:**

* **Keys:** Two keys are used — Public key `(n, e)` and Private key `(n, d)`.
* **Based on:** Difficulty of factoring large composite numbers.

**Process:**

1. **Key Generation:**

   * Choose two large primes `p` and `q`.
   * Compute `n = p × q` and `φ(n) = (p-1)(q-1)`.
   * Choose public exponent `e` such that `1 < e < φ(n)` and gcd(e, φ(n)) = 1.
   * Compute private key `d` such that `e × d ≡ 1 (mod φ(n))`.
2. **Encryption:** `C = (M^e) mod n`
3. **Decryption:** `M = (C^d) mod n`

**Applications:**

* Secure communication
* Digital signatures
* Key exchange protocols

**Example:**
If `p=3, q=11`, then `n=33`, `φ=20`.
Choose `e=3`, then `d=7`.
For message `M=4`:
Encryption → `C = 4^3 mod 33 = 31`
Decryption → `M = 31^7 mod 33 = 4`. ✅
