## Question 7 Answers

### (a) What is Web Security?

**Web security** refers to the protection of websites, web applications, and online services from cyberattacks that aim to steal data, disrupt functionality, or gain unauthorized access. It ensures **confidentiality, integrity, and availability** of web resources.

**Key objectives:**

* Prevent unauthorized access to data or servers.
* Protect users from phishing, malware, and identity theft.
* Secure communication using HTTPS, SSL/TLS encryption.
* Maintain trust through authentication and access control.

### (b) Compare the Different Threats on the Web

|       **Type of Threat**       | **Description**                                                           | **Example / Impact**                 |
| :----------------------------: | :------------------------------------------------------------------------ | :----------------------------------- |
|          **Phishing**          | Fraudulent attempts to steal user credentials by mimicking trusted sites. | Fake login pages, email scams.       |
| **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)** | Injecting malicious scripts into webpages viewed by other users.          | Stealing cookies, session hijacking. |
|        **SQL Injection**       | Inserting SQL code into input fields to manipulate databases.             | Data leakage or deletion.            |
|   **Denial-of-Service (DoS)**  | Flooding a server with traffic to make it unavailable.                    | Website downtime or crash.           |
|  **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM)**  | Intercepting communication between two parties.                           | Credential theft, session hijacking. |
|    **Malware & Ransomware**    | Injecting harmful software to encrypt or steal data.                      | System compromise or data ransom.    |

### (c) What is an Intruder? How can you protect a Password File?

**Intruder:**
An **intruder** is an unauthorized person or software that tries to gain access to a system or network by exploiting vulnerabilities. Intruders can be external hackers or malicious insiders.

**Types of Intruders:**

* **Masquerader:** External user who pretends to be an authorized one.
* **Misfeasor:** Legitimate user misusing their privileges.
* **Clandestine User:** Gains administrative control to hide their actions.

**Protecting the Password File:**

1. **Hashing:** Store hashed passwords instead of plaintext (e.g., using bcrypt, Argon2, SHA-512).
2. **Salting:** Add random data (salt) to passwords before hashing to prevent rainbow table attacks.
3. **Access Control:** Restrict file permissions so only authorized processes can read it.
4. **Encryption:** Encrypt the password database using strong symmetric keys.
5. **Monitoring:** Regularly check logs for unauthorized access attempts.

**Example:**
Instead of storing `password123`, store `hash(salt + password123)` using a secure algorithm â€” making it computationally infeasible to recover the original password.
